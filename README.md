# Revit Architecture Plugin
This little project was my first inspiration towards becoming professional software engineer. Back then I was working as a Building Information Modeler in the 
construction industry. We used Autodesk Revit Architecture everyday to model buildings. However creating lots of views and placing floor plans on the view sheet
was tiresome and boring. I created this little plugin for me to automate the process.

I made these demo videos as I worked on the plugins.

I worked a month on this, I was familiar with basic coding so I started experimenting with Dynamo (a visual programming tool that came with Revit).
Then I learned the a bit C# because Revit API was in C#. I learned a lot along the way, it was hard for me as a non programmer to familirize myself with 
Revit API. But after a month of fiddling I actually built it.
